# Chess
A version of chess I coded up in a day with all of the mechanics of the actual game except checkmates. To win, you would have to actually take the king.
To run the game, run the main method of ChessGame.java, or you could just solely download and run the Chess - by Ryan Cheng jar file by double clicking on it.
